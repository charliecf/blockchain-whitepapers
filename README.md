## Blockchain 101
Blockchain is an algorithm and distributed data structure designed to manage electronic cash without any central administrator.

Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology.

Central problem that blockchain tackles is the _double spend_ problem:
If electronic money is just data, nothing physically stops a currency holder trying to spend it twice. It was long thought that a digital reserve was needed to oversee and catch double-spends.

The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain crowd-sources the oversight. Each and every attempted spend is broadcast to a community, which in effect votes on the order in which transactions occur. Once a majority agrees that all transactions seen in the recent past are unique, they are cryptographically sealed into a block. A chain thereby grows, each new block linked to the previously accepted history, preserving every spend ever made.
